# AWS-ECS-with-docker
hands-on #project where I developed a calculator app, containerized it using #Docker, and deployed it on #AWS #ECS with #Fargate! 🌐 

➡ AWS #ECS is a scalable container orchestration service that simplifies running and managing Docker containers. I used ECS with Fargate to deploy my calculator app for serverless container management.

 ->#Cluster: Group of Tasks and Services, hosts all the resources and infrastructure.
 
 ->#Service: Handles Scalability and Load balancing of container.
 
 ->#Task: Represents the running containers of your Application.
 

➡ Amazon #Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers that allows you to run containers without having to manage the underlying infrastructure. It removes the need to provision, configure, and scale virtual machines. 

➡ I used #DockerHub to push my calculator app's image for easy access and sharing. I also practiced pulling images to ensure smooth deployment across environments, simplifying container management and version control.  give a hading and discript this project in one sentence
